Spell casting rules:

Terminology:
    - result = an array of instances of the Spell class (generated with the SpellResult.CalculateResult() function)
    - effect type = an enum of type EffectType defined in the SpellEffect class
    - effect pair = a pair of two effects - one being of type MODE and one of type EFFECT that have the same spell level assigned
    - valid result = the result is completely made up of only effect pairs (e.g. Fire 2, Ray 2, Ice 1, Charge 1)
    - partial result = the result is made out of at least one effect pair (e.g. Thunder 1, Dome 2, Void 3, Wave 3)
    - invalid result = the result does not contain any effect pairs (e.g. Air 2, Storm 1, Earth 3)
        OR there are more than two effects in the same pair (e.g. Air 2, Charge 2, Earth 2)
        OR both of effects in the pair are either MODE or EFFECT (e.g. Fire 1, Ray 1, Air 2, Thunder 2)

1. If the spell result is a valid result:
    The spell will be cast in a regular order.

2. If the spell result is a partial result:
    The spell will not be cast (particle indicators will be shown instead).

3. If the spell result is an invalid result:
    The spell will not be cast and all runes involved in the spell will be removed (broken) from the inventory.
